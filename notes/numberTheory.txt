Divisibility: Number theory deals with divisibility properties, including prime and composite numbers, factors, and multiples.

  > "a" is divisible by "b" if there exists an integer "c" such that "a = b * c."
  > 6 = 3 * 2
  > a = b * c

  To determine if one number is divisible by another, you can use the following rules:

  - If a number is divisible by 2, it is even.
  - If a number ends in 0 or 5, it is divisible by 5.
  - If the sum of its digits is divisible by 3, the number itself is divisible by 3.
  - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
  - A number is divisible by 4 if the last two digits are divisible by 4.

GCD and LCM: Number theory explores properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two or more numbers.

  // GCD (Gratest common multi...)
    let x = 48;
    let y = 18;

    let r;
    while (x % y > 0) {
      r = x % y;
      x = y;
      y = r;
    }

    console.log(r); // 6

  // LCM (Least common multi...)

  function findGCD(a, b) {
      if (b === 0) {
          return a;
      } else {
          return findGCD(b, a % b);
      }
  }

  // Function to calculate the LCM using the GCD
  function findLCM(a, b) {
      const gcd = findGCD(a, b);
      const lcm = (a * b) / gcd;
      return lcm;
  }

Modular Arithmetic: Modular arithmetic is the study of numbers with respect to a fixed modulus. It plays a significant role in number theory and has applications in cryptography.

Congruence Relations: Number theory deals with congruence relations, which are relationships between numbers that have the same remainder when divided by a fixed integer (modulus).

Diophantine Equations: Diophantine equations are equations with integer solutions only. Number theory addresses methods for finding solutions to these equations.

Prime Factorization: Prime factorization is the process of representing a number as a product of prime numbers. It's crucial for various mathematical and computational applications.

Fermat's Last Theorem: A famous problem in number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem, was an open problem for centuries until it was proven by Andrew Wiles in 1994.

Congruences and Residue Classes: The study of congruences, residue classes, and modular arithmetic is a fundamental part of number theory.
